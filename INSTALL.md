### Installation - preparation

If you need some help for installation, here its the place.

First, you will need a Linux distro installed and running.

Second, install docker and docker compose.

Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
In Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

With docker and docker-compose installed, you just need to 
execute the scripts to start the containers.
